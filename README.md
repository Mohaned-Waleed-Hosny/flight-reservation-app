## Database Information

- Uses SQLite database (`flights.db`)
- Automatically creates necessary tables
- Stores all reservation data locally

## Building the Executable

To create your own executable:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Notes

- All files are in the same directory for simplicity
- The application creates and uses `flights.db` automatically
- No external dependencies besides Python standard libraries
